# Grade Calculator Plus

This is a improved version of a simple grade calculator I created in 9th grade (https://eric8900.github.io/GradeCalculator/). 

It calculates the lowest grade that you need for your next assessment (Test, Quiz, Other grade) to keep a desired grade that you entered in. (Example: You need an XX on your next test to keep a 90 average)

## Improved Features

- Log In with Home Access Center directly for quick access of grades
- Less typing because all of your grades are loaded from Home Access Center
- More intuitive feel 

## Technologies Used

- HTML and Javascript
- Tailwind CSS
- My Home Access Center API (https://github.com/Eric8900/HomeAccessAPI-Python)
